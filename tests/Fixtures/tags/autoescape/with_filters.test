4. Escape non-escaper filter output
( var is upper-cased by |upper,

5. Escape if last filter is not an escaper
( var is escaped by |escape_and_nl2br, line-breaks are added,
  the output is upper-cased by |upper,
  the output is auto-escaped as |upper is not an escaper )

9. Don't escape escaper filter output
( the output of |format is "<b>" ~ var ~ "</b>",
